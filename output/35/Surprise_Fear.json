[[2, " Hi, what's up?", "SURPRISE"], [1, " Have you ever been on a surprise vacation before?"], [2, " No, what is that?", "SURPRISE"], [1, " It's when someone plans out a vacation for you, without telling you where you're going! They just tell you what to pack."], [2, " Oh wow, that's interesting! But, isn't the destination part of the fun?", "SURPRISE"], [1, " It's like a bit more exciting than just packing your bags and going. I mean, sometimes you need a bit of uncertainty!"], [2, " Yeah, that's a valid point. What kind of people are these surprise vacations for?", "SURPRISE"], [1, " It's for anyone who wants to go on a holiday, but doesn't want the stress and expectations of a normal planned holiday."], [2, " That makes sense, but to be honest, I'd be a bit too nervous to try it!", "SURPRISE"], [1, " Yeah, it can be a bit nerve-wracking, but the idea is to let go and trust in other people's planning."], [2, " Hmm, I'll have to think about it. Maybe someday when I'm feeling a little more adventurous.", "SURPRISE"], [1, " Absolutely! Take your time and do what feels right for you. There's no rush to push your boundaries if you're not ready for it."], [2, " Yeah, you're right. Thanks for the advice and for telling me about surprise vacations.", "SURPRISE"], [1, " No problem! I'm always here to chat and give advice."]]
