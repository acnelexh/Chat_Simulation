[[2, " Wow! I can\u2019t believe it! I found my old yearbook from primary school! Look at all these pictures! Oh my goodness, look at my hair! Haha! I remember this day, it was the sports day, our team won the relay race! What a great memory!", "Surprise"], [1, " It sounds like you\u2019re having a lot of fun looking back at old memories! Who\u2019s that in the picture with you?"], [2, " Oh, that\u2019s my best friend, Jane! We were inseparable back then. We used to do everything together, from playing sports to studying for exams. We had so many adventures together.", "Surprise"], [1, " It\u2019s wonderful to have such a close friend. Have you kept in touch with her over the years?"], [2, " Unfortunately, no. We lost touch after we finished primary school. We went to different high schools and started making new friends. But I often think about her and wonder how she\u2019s doing.", "Surprise"], [1, " It\u2019s always hard when you lose touch with someone who was once so important to you. Do you think you\u2019d ever try to reconnect with her?"], [2, " I\u2019ve thought about it, but I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019d even remember me. It\u2019s been so long, and we\u2019ve both changed a lot since then. Plus, I heard from a mutual friend that she moved to a different country a few years ago.", "Surprise"], [1, " I can see why that would make it difficult. It\u2019s still nice to look back on those memories and remember the good times you had together."], [2, " Yes, it definitely brings back a lot of happy memories. I\u2019m grateful for the time we spent together. We had such a carefree childhood, without a lot of the worries and responsibilities that adults have. I miss those days sometimes.", "Neutral"], [1, " It\u2019s natural to feel nostalgic for your childhood. But it\u2019s also important to appreciate the present and the experiences that have shaped you into the person you are today."], [2, " You\u2019re right. I\u2019ve learned a lot and grown so much since then. I have my own family now, and even though there are challenges and responsibilities, it\u2019s also very rewarding.", "Neutral"], [1, " I\u2019m glad to hear that. It sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for. And who knows, maybe one day you\u2019ll have the opportunity to reconnect with your old friend and share your new experiences with her."], [2, " Yeah, maybe. It\u2019s just frustrating to think about all the lost connections and missed opportunities. But I guess that\u2019s just life, right?", "Anger"], [1, "I understand why you might feel that way. Life is full of ups and downs, and sometimes we have to let go of things that are out of our control. But it\u2019s important to focus on the positive things in your life and the relationships that you do have."], [2, " Yeah, I suppose you\u2019re right. Thanks for listening.", "Anger"], [1, "No problem at all. I\u2019m always here to listen if you need someone to talk to."]]
