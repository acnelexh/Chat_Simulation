I've tried talking to them about it, but things haven't improved much. It's really frustrating and hurtful.", "Anger"], [1, " I can understand why you would feel frustrated and hurt by this change in behavior from your partner. It's important to communicate your feelings to them and have an open and honest conversation about your needs and concerns. Have you considered seeking relationship counseling or therapy to help navigate through this situation?"], [2, " I've thought about it, but I'm worried it might create even more tension between us. Plus, my partner is not very open to the idea of therapy. I just wish they would make more of an effort to prioritize our relationship and show that they still care.", "Anger"], [1, " It can be challenging when one partner is resistant to seeking professional help. However, in situations like this, therapy can offer a neutral and supportive environment for both of you to express your thoughts and concerns. It may be worth discussing the potential benefits and exploring different approaches to resolving the current issues in your relationship. Remember, taking care of your own well-being is important too."]]
