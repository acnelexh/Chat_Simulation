[[1, " Hey there! How's your day going? Anything interesting happening lately?"], [2, " Ugh, don't get me started! My husband promised he would fix the leaky faucet in the bathroom weeks ago, but he still hasn't done anything about it!", "ANGER"], [1, " Oh no, that sounds frustrating. Have you tried talking to him about it again?"], [2, " Yes, I've talked to him multiple times! It's like he doesn't care about our home or my feelings. I'm so tired of reminding him!", "ANGER"], [1, " I can understand why you're feeling angry. It's important to have a functional living space. Have you considered getting a professional to fix the faucet instead?"], [2, " I shouldn't have to spend extra money on a professional just because my husband can't keep his promises! It's not fair!", "ANGER"], [1, " I completely get where you're coming from. Relationships can be challenging when there's a breakdown in communication or unfulfilled expectations. Have you talked to him about the impact this is having on you?"], [2, " Actually, something surprising happened yesterday. Out of nowhere, my daughter came over and fixed the faucet herself! She's always been the handy one in the family, but she lives far away so I didn't expect her to come and help.", "SURPRISE"], [1, " Wow, that's truly a pleasant surprise! It's great to have such a supportive and capable daughter. How did you feel when she fixed the faucet?"], [2, " I was completely shocked! And honestly, I felt a mix of pride and relief. It was really nice to see her take care of things and resolve the issue. It made me realize that even when things don't go as planned, unexpected moments of support can still happen.", "SURPRISE"]]
