[[1, " Hey, how's everything going?"], [2, " Oh, I didn't expect you to show up!", "Surprise"], [1, " Well, surprise! I'm here to hang out with you today."], [2, " Hmm, alright then.", "Surprise"], [2, " So, are we just gonna sit here in silence or what?", "Surprise"], [1, " No, I thought we could talk. How's your day been so far?"], [2, " Well, work was fine, nothing new there. What about you?", "Surprise"], [1, " Same old, same old. So, how are things going with you and Maria?"], [2, " Wait, you know that we broke up, right? She told you that, right?", "Surprise"], [1, " Oh, sorry. My bad. No, she didn't tell me. I just assumed you were still together."], [2, " No, unfortunately not. We broke up about a month ago. It was a mutual decision though.", "Disgust"], [1, " That's too bad. I thought you guys were good together. What happened?"], [2, " It's just so frustrating. We were just on two different pages, you know? Like, we wanted completely different things.", "Disgust"], [1, " Yeah, I can see how that can cause a strain on the relationship. So, are you still friends?"], [2, " Yeah, we're trying to be. It's just hard, you know? There are still a lot of lingering feelings and it's just awkward sometimes.", "Neutral"], [2, " And to top it all off, she's already seeing someone else. Can you believe that? Just a month after we broke up!", "Disgust"], [1, " Wow, that's tough. I can understand why you would be feeling a bit disgusted by that."], [2, " Disgusted is an understatement. It's just so disrespectful. And it makes me feel like I meant nothing to her.", "Disgust"], [1, " I can see how that would hurt. It's important to remember that it's not a reflection of your worth though."], [2, " Yeah, I know. It's just hard not to take it personally. It feels like a slap in the face, you know?", "Disgust"], [1, " I get it. Emotions run high during a breakup. Just give yourself some time, and you'll start feeling better soon."], [2, " I hope so. I just need some distance from all of this right now.", "Disgust"], [1, " I understand. Take all the time you need. And remember, I'm here for you if you ever need to vent or talk."], [2, " Thanks, I appreciate it.", "Disgust"], [2, " Anyway, enough about me. How's everything going with you?", "Disgust"], [1, " Oh, you know, same old, same old. Nothing much happening."]]
