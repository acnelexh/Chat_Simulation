You know how it goes.", "SURPRISE"], [1, " Did you have to pay a lot this year?"], [2, " No, I actually got a refund this time.", "NEUTRAL"], [1, " That's great, did you have it directly deposited into your account?"], [2, " Yes, it was much faster that way.", "NEUTRAL"], [1, " Good call on direct deposit. Hey, how are the kids doing these days?"], [2, " The kids are doing well, thanks for asking. My daughter just bought her first car.", "NEUTRAL"], [1, " Wow, that's a big step. I'm sure she's excited. Did she get a good deal on it?"], [2, " She did, but it's still quite an expense. She's trying to save up for a down payment on a house as well.", "NEUTRAL"], [1, " It's tough, isn't it? Buying a car and saving for a house at the same time. But it sounds like she's on the right track."], [2, " Yes, she's very responsible with her money.

Is there anything I can do to help?"], [2, " It's nice of you to offer, but there's not much you can do. I just needed to vent.", "ANGER"], [1, " I understand. Sometimes it helps to talk about it.
